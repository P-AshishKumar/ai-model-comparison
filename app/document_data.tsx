1.0 Overview

University employees use smart phones and tablets (smart devices) as a means of sending and

receiving university email, synchronizing calendars and contacts, transmitting text messages

and connecting to the Internet. The purpose of this policy is to describe the conditions under

which the university permits the use of smart devices for its employees, and how the university

manages mobile technology to minimize risk, especially in the event of loss or theft.


2.0 Scope

This policy applies to WPI faculty, staff, contractors, vendors, and other personnel who are

granted privileges to access WPI resources.


3.0 Smart Device Definition

For the purposes of this policy, a smart device is a small form factor, typically handheld device

with at least one wireless network interface for network access for data communications. This

interface can use Wi-Fi, cellular networking or other technologies that connect to the Internet

or other data networks.

The device contains local non-removable data storage and an operating system (OS) specific for

the hardware of device.


4.0 University Owned Mobile Devices

Certain university employees are required to use smart devices to facilitate university business.

Supervisors must identify those employees who require a smart device as part of their job

responsibilities. The Information Technology department directly works with these individuals

to assist with the purchase of a mobile device and the appropriate data/voice plan.

Employees are allowed incidental personal use of university owned smart devices as long as no

applicable state or federal laws, and no university polices, are being violated by such use.

Employees are reminded that university owned smart devices, data stored on a device, and the

data/voice plans and records are sole property of the university. When an employee leaves the

university the mobile device is to be wiped of WPI information and at the discretion of the

1|Page


employee’s Department the device can be given to or purchased by the employee, or returned

to the University for recycling or redeployment.

University-owned smart devices must have the manufacturer’s installed operating system (OS)

and vendor updates must be accepted and installed when required.

Configuration of Mobile Devices

IT will administer and configure all mobile devices that are purchased by the University. For

Apple devices (iPhones, iPads), a supervision notification, directed by Apple, will appear on the

main Settings page of these devices. This will state that the device is being managed by WPI,

which includes configuration of wireless settings, improved setup assistance, and a remote

wipe if there is a security breach. WPI will not use this administration tool to track employees;

it is a standard vendor banner displayed on iOS devices and is for security management only.


5.0 Personally Owned Mobile Devices

The university recognizes and allows employees, although not required to use a smart device as

a requirement of their position, to connect personally owned smart devices to the university’s

resources to access and synchronize email data, contacts, and calendar information. All usage

use must comply with state and federal laws, as well as with the university’s own policies

governing appropriate use of technology.

Personally owned smart devices that use university resources must have the manufacturer’s

installed operating system (OS) and keep current as possible of vendor updates.


6.0 Smart Device Security (university and personally owned)

If an employee, either due to work-related requirements or through their own personal choice,

elects to access university’s sensitive resources, which includes email, Workday or Salesforce,

via a smart device, they must accept the security policies defined by the university that may be

downloaded, installed and/or configured on the device upon connecting to university

resources. The smart device security policies are designed to accomplish the following primary

objectives.

Require a pin/password/passcode to unlock the device

Remotely wipe the device in the event of 10 failed login attempts

Remotely wipe the device in the event that the device is lost or stolen

Limit the amount of email that can be stored on the device to 4 weeks




The OS must be the one designed and built for the specific hardware. The OS is not to be

modified in any way that compromises the device’s security. Jailbreaking, the act of altering a

smart device’s OS, is strictly prohibited when connecting to WPI’s sensitive resources.

Report a Lost or Stolen Mobile Device

A lost or stolen mobile device containing university data, whether university or personally

owned, must be reported to Information Security by contacting Infosec@wpi.edu or calling the

IT Service Desk at x5888 as soon as possible (ASAP). The missing device will be remotely wiped

of all data to protect the university and the user from data lost.

Exceptions

The mission of WPI’s Information Technology division is to support the WPI community with its

academic and research objectives. We understand that in pursuit of these research and

academic endeavors, exceptions to this policy may be required. For any faculty, student, or

staff that requires an exception, please contact WPI’s Chief Information Security Officer.
